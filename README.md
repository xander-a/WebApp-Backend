# Time Tracking System

This is a time-tracking system built with **Java Spring Boot** and **ReactJS**. It connects to a **PostgreSQL database** within a **Docker container** environment.

## Features

### User Registration and Login
- **Register**: If you don’t have an account, click **Register** to create one.
- **Login**: After logging in, you’ll see your current status (Timed In, Timed Out, or blank if not active).

### Time In and Time Out
- **Time In**: This form appears after login. If no previous record exists, it proceeds to the homepage, displaying your information. Otherwise, it shows that you are already timed in.
  - **Note**: Ensure your profile information is accurate, as it’s required to successfully time in.
- **Time Out**: Similar process and functionalities as Time In.
